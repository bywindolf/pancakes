A straightforward assignment, focusing solely on writing **HTML** and **CSS**. There was no need to make design decisions; the task was simply to base the code on an already provided design.

I’ve already decided to make use of **Tailwind CSS** and learn the basics. In the past, during my career, delivering handcrafted PSDs to developers was almost never satisfying. I realized that achieving the right results without using some sort of framework, like Bootstrap (never going back), takes time — time I wanted to save for other learning priorities that specific week.

As a designer who has managed HTML and CSS since the mid-nineties, this was a real game-changer for me. It made it so much easier to lay out a foundation with clear tags that describe what each section is about. It’s not that I wasn’t aware of them, but I didn’t fully understand the importance of using them. **_After all, the Internet is for everyone._**

## **My Achievements**

- [x] First made use of regular `<div>` elements
- [x] Changing them accordingly to use **HTML5 semantic elements**.
